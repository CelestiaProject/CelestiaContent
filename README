Texture maps
------------

# The new textures repository in their original quality can be found here:
https://www.deviantart.com/celestiaofficial/gallery/68412929/Release-Textures

   In particular, there are textures of Jupiter, Saturn, Phobos and Deimos.

# Most of the old maps are from David Seal's site: http://maps.jpl.nasa.gov/.

   Some of these maps were modified, with fictional terrain added to fill in
   gaps. The Galileo spacecraft model is also from David Seal's site (though
   it was converted from Inventor to 3DS format.)

# The Mars, Neptune, and Uranus textures and Mars bump maps are all from James
  Hastings-Trew's collection.

# Grant Hutchison

   Saturn's rings were built by Grant Hutchison from Cassini imaging.

   The Eros map is a shaded relief generated from the NEAR laser rangefinder.

# Jens Meyer

   Dione and Rhea are USGS maps colored and modified by Jens Meyer.

   The Moon map is based on data from PDS Map-A-Planet at with colors from
   Mark Robinson.

# Fridger Schrempp

   'Available data' Pluto and Charon textures using maps created by Marc Buie
   at Lowell Observatory.  Buie's maps were generated from photometric data
   gathered during six years of mutual occultations of Pluto and Charon.

   Titan's cloud texture in natural colors and its surface map at near-infrared
   wavelength. They are based on resources available from the imaging site
   (Ciclops) of the Cassini mission http://ciclops.org/

   The Phoebe base texture was created from the cylindrical map published by
   the Cassini imaging team
   (http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07775)

   The Tethys textures are based on the Oct 2008 Ciclops map
   (http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11116)

   The Iapetus texture was created from the Oct 2008 Ciclops map
   (http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11116)

   The Lunar topography and bump maps, using Clementine laser altimeter data,
   merged in the polar regions with topographic data  from Clementine 750 nm
   oblique and nadir images.

   The Mercury map was created from a combination of Mariner 10 imaging
   with recent MESSENGER WAC images from the first two flybys, as collected
   and reprojected by Steve Albers.

# Phil Stooke

   Proteus, Janus, Prometheus and Epimetheus maps are from Phil Stooke.

   The Ida and Gaspra photomosaic maps are by Phil Stooke.

# Venus's clouds and the textures for Ganymede, Callisto and Saturn are from
  Björn Jónsson.

# Venus's surface is a copyright-free NASA image, prepared from Magellan radar
  data. The original is available at
    http://www.solarviews.com/cap/venus/venmap.htm

# The Earth texture was created by NASA using data from the MODIS instrument
  aboard the Terra satellite.

# Steve Albers
   The Io and Europa maps are by Steve Albers.

# The textures for the Uranian satellites were created by Ivan Rivera from JPL
  data. His Celestia page is: http://bruckner.homelinux.net/celestia.html

# The Hyperion map is a photomosaic assembled by Phil Stooke and
  colored by Jens Meyer.

# Amalthea is a shaded relief map by Phil Stooke, colored by Wm. Robert Johnston
  (http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/spaceart/cylmaps.html), and further modified
  by Jens Meyer and Grant Hutchison.

# The asteroid.jpg texture was created by Paul Roberts.

# The textures for the five classes of extrasolar giant planet were created by
  Andrew Tribick.

# CICLOPS

  The map of Enceladus is derived from the December 2008 CICLOPS map:
  http://ciclops.org/view/5447/Map_of_Enceladus_December_2008
