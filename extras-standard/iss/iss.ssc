# International Space Station
#
# This is a 3D representation of the ISS created by NASA-VTAD
# on April 22, 2019
#
# ORIGINAL LINK:
# https://science.nasa.gov/resource/international-space-station-3d-model/
#
# The configuration shown is what the ISS looked like from May
# 2011 until February 2015, shortly after STS-134 (Endeavour)
# delivered the AMS and ELC-3 pallets to the station.
#
# Model and textures were converted for use in Celestia by 
# DaveBowman2001
#
# Orbital elements used were retrieved from JPL HORIZONS using
# Epoch 2024-Nov-20 (JD 2460634.5), i.e. the station's 26th
# anniversary since launch
